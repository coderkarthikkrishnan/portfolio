                    Hi, I’m Karthik Krishnan — a passionate Web Developer, Educator, and Tech Community Lead.
                    I specialize in building modern, responsive web applications using React, Django, and MySQL, with a strong focus on clean UI, performance, and user experience.

                    I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) and work as a Programming Staff at a computer center, where I guide students in mastering coding fundamentals and real-world projects.
                    As a Google Developer Community Co-Lead, I also help organize developer events and workshops that inspire innovation and collaboration among peers.

                    Outside of coding, I’m a photography enthusiast, capturing stories through creative visuals.
                    My mission is to merge technology and creativity to build impactful digital experiences that make a difference.
